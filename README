This application is a first attempt at creating an iOS-based application
that implements some of the Ground Control Station functionality of
the existing Paparazzi GCS.

The app connects to the same Ivy-bus that all the ground based Paparazzi
UAV software connects to. This means that the iOS device needs some kind
of network connection to the Paparazzi GCS, either via bluetooth, wifi, or
cable.

The app is implemented as a 'universal' app, meaning that it can run on both
iPads and iPhones.

In its current form, it is purely intended as a prototype, and should be used
in that way. Any feedback or offers to contribute to further develop this app
are highly appreciated!
